	description = Fed up with the tedious business of landing your vessel?  Us too, so this uses Quadratic Programming mathematical magic to compute an optimal set of thrust directions over time giving a trajectory leading to a soft touch down at a landing spot of your choice. No guarantees if you run out of fuel.
