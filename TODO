- Show path travelled by vessel
- Get a working Visual Studio Project file
- Make show track toggle work properly with steer and align vectors
- Get align vector in the right place again
- Realtime tinkering of correct factors
- Check speed, minDescentAngle check so more around start and finish to cope better when outside of constraints at start
- Combine code for force landing and autopilot landing
- Ensure tracks can be toggled to forced landing
- Further tuning of PIDs and simplifying parameters for small/large craft
- Logging for forced landing
- More accurate computation of trajectory
