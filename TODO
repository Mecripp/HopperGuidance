- Better handling of when there is no solution
- Add constraints to keep above ground
- Add separate colour for thrust vectors
- Allow toggling visualization of track
- Fix bugs with showing/hidding and with duplicate targets/tracks
- Let target be moved again
- Make ClosestToTrajectory() interpolate from nearest points (might not be necessary)
- Ensure simulation of trajectory (consider keyframe based method) ends a end-point and adjust if not
